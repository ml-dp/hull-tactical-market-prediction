### Project Log

**Date:** 2023-10-27

**Analysis of Existing Codebase:**

1.  **`Hull_Market_Prediction.ipynb`:** This notebook contains a sophisticated ensemble model (ElasticNet, XGBoost, LightGBM) with a meta-learner. Its core logic is sound and provides an excellent architectural blueprint. The key challenge is that its feature engineering is based on proprietary, anonymized data from a Kaggle competition, which we cannot replicate directly.

2.  **`explore.ipynb`:** This notebook represents the initial effort to adapt the Kaggle solution to live market data using the `yfinance` library. The notebook successfully replicates the modeling logic but fails in its final step when attempting to fetch data for SPY.

3.  **`data_pipeline.py`:** This file contains the `LiveDataHandler` class responsible for interacting with the `yfinance` API.

**Error Identification:**

*   **`TypeError` in `explore.ipynb`:** The notebook fails with the following error:
    ```
    TypeError: PriceHistory.history() got an unexpected keyword argument 'progress'
    ```
*   **Root Cause:** The error originates in `data_pipeline.py` on line 27. The `yfinance.Ticker.history()` method call includes a `progress=False` parameter. This parameter is no longer supported in the current version of the `yfinance` library, leading to the crash.

**Proposed Fix:**

*   Remove the `progress=False` argument from the `self.tk.history()` call in `data_pipeline.py`. The corrected line should be:
    ```python
    self.data = self.tk.history(period=period, interval=interval, auto_adjust=False)
    ```

**Next Actions:**

*   Create `01_YFinance_Exploration.ipynb` to implement the fix and begin a deep dive into the `yfinance` API, as per Phase 2 of our project plan.
