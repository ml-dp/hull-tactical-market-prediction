### The Revised 12-Phase Project Plan

This plan is designed to be methodical, ensuring that each step builds a solid foundation for the next, from initial exploration to final deployment.

**Phase 1: Codebase & Domain Comprehension**
*   **Objective:** Fully understand the existing work and the proprietary logic of the original Kaggle solution.
*   **Actions:**
    1.  **Analyze `Hull_Market_Prediction.ipynb`:** I will start by dissecting this notebook to map out its exact feature engineering, model architecture, and the logic behind the `get_allocations` function.
    2.  **Review `explore.ipynb` & `data_pipeline.py`:** Next, I'll examine these files to understand the initial steps taken to transition to `yfinance` and where the challenges were encountered.

**Phase 2: Deep Dive into `yfinance` API**
*   **Objective:** Exhaustively map out all the data points `yfinance` can provide for an asset like SPY. We won't limit ourselves to the obvious.
*   **Notebook:** `01_YFinance_Exploration.ipynb`
*   **Actions:** I will create a dedicated notebook to query and document everything available: full options chains, all greeks, financials, news feeds, corporate actions, etc.

**Phase 3: Foundational Equity Data Pipeline**
*   **Objective:** Build a robust pipeline for fetching and processing equity data, replicating the *concepts* from the original notebook with live data.
*   **Notebook:** `02_Equity_Data_Pipeline.ipynb`
*   **Actions:** Refine `data_pipeline.py`'s logic to fetch historical equity data and re-engineer the technical analysis features (RSI, MACD, etc.) using `pandas-ta` on `yfinance` data.

**Phase 4: Foundational Options Data Pipeline**
*   **Objective:** Create the first version of the options data ingestion pipeline.
*   **Notebook:** `03_Options_Data_Pipeline.ipynb`
*   **Actions:** Write functions to fetch full options chains for various expirations and calculate the initial set of features (Put/Call Ratio, ATM IV).

**Phase 5: Advanced Options Feature Engineering**
*   **Objective:** Go beyond the basics to engineer sophisticated, proprietary features from the options data.
*   **Notebook:** `04_Advanced_Options_Features.ipynb`
*   **Actions:** Calculate a rich set of features including: Volatility Skew/Smile, Term Structure, Gamma Exposure (GEX), Vanna, and Charm. This will be our "secret sauce."

**Phase 6: Comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
*   **Objective:** Visualize and analyze our newly engineered features to build intuition and formulate hypotheses.
*   **Notebook:** `05_Comprehensive_EDA.ipynb`
*   **Actions:** Create visualizations for all our features and analyze their correlations with future price movements of SPY.

**Phase 7: Baseline Modeling**
*   **Objective:** Establish a performance benchmark by adapting the original model to our new data sources.
*   **Notebook:** `06_Baseline_Model.ipynb`
*   **Actions:** I will retrain the model from `Hull_Market_Prediction.ipynb` using the equity features derived from `yfinance`. Its performance will be the benchmark we need to beat.

**Phase 8: Advanced Modeling & Experimentation**
*   **Objective:** Systematically experiment with various advanced models to find the one with the highest predictive power.
*   **Notebook:** `07_Advanced_Modeling.ipynb`
*   **Actions:** We will test multiple architectures (XGBoost, LightGBM, LSTMs) using our full set of equity and advanced options features. This will be a rigorous, competitive process.

**Phase 9: Strategy Backtesting & Validation**
*   **Objective:** Rigorously test the profitability of our best models in a realistic trading simulation.
*   **Notebook:** `08_Backtesting.ipynb`
*   **Actions:** We will build a high-fidelity backtesting engine that incorporates our `get_allocations` logic and accounts for trading costs. We'll calculate Sharpe/Sortino Ratios and Maximum Drawdown.

**Phase 10: Final Model Selection**
*   **Objective:** Select the champion model and prepare it for "production."
*   **Notebook:** `09_Final_Model_Selection.ipynb`
*   **Actions:** Based on the backtesting results, I will formally select the best-performing model and document its characteristics.

**Phase 11: Production Pipeline Implementation**
*   **Objective:** Consolidate our work into a single, automated script that can be run on a schedule.
*   **File:** `prediction_pipeline.py`
*   **Actions:** I will refactor the code from the modeling and data notebooks into a clean, efficient Python script that fetches data, engineers features, and generates a final allocation prediction.

**Phase 12: Real-Time Dashboard Creation**
*   **Objective:** Build the interactive, user-facing dashboard.
*   **File:** `dashboard.py` (using Streamlit)
*   **Actions:** I will develop the dashboard to execute the `prediction_pipeline.py` every 30 minutes and display the critical outputs: the live allocation signal, GEX exposure charts, volatility skew plots, and other key data points for users.
